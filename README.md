# Python---Telco-Customer-Churn-EDA

Customer churn is a fundamental problem for the telecommunication (Telco) industry. It is defined as the loss of customers moved from one Telco operator to another. If customer churn can be predicted in advance, such as “is this customer going to leave us within the next X months?”, Telco operators can apply business marketing policies to such churn customers to retain and increase the customer base. In particular, given millions of Telco customers, even reducing the 1% churn rate will lead to a significant profit increase.

**Telco** churn data includes information about a fictitious telecom company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7,043 California customers in the third quarter. Which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service shows?

In this project we will make Exploratory Data Analysis to figure out which attributes lead customers to leave the company.
